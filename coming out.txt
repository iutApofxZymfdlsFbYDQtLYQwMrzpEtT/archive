if you're reading this, then you found me. congrats, now to let you in on something: 
i'm coming out as transfem. 
at least to you i am, other people have yet to know before i make this a public thing, which i plan to announce around new years. i might detransition back to being bigender or just detransition entirely before new years, who knows rly.
to be honest, this was something that i've been considering for a really long time, since around late 2022 or early 2023 if i recall correctly lmao
i dont know really, i guess i just feel more comfortable calling myself a girl instead of a guy
i like girly things, honestly. makes me feel more at home instead of the usual things boys do, which are kind of lame tbhhhhh
a thought entered my mind that i could be genderfluid, but the reason why im coming out as transfem is because my current state of being bigender feels just dysphoric imo, so genderfluid wouldnt do much for me
and GOD FORBID i come out as a future grooming victim and identify as a "femboy" at 15
(no offense to other people who identify as such, at least no offense to the sane people under that label)
tl;dr, im transgender, and i couldnt have it any other way. gbye :]
